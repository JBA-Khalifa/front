             "body":"> by 0xefd13f676744a527b1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8 (Remy)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe components of this idea is that it will boost commerce on Decentraland, raise brand awareness of the creators and their stores, and bring more attention to the platform for it's ingenuity and creative events. This will be an NFT rebate and referral voucher meant to incentivize players to purchase wearables from participating vendors as well as to share the rebate via referring a friend's wallet address, whereby the voucher then shows up in there wallet available to use on their first purchase. The voucher will become void if it is not used in a specified time frame. I will describe the model in more detail in the description field.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xeFd13F676744a527B1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8\n\n## Description\n\nThe Circulating Rebate/Referral voucher is an NFT voucher designed to allow the player to receive a 10% discount on their next NFT purchase after making an initial purchase at participating vendor's stores. After the voucher is redeemed for the discount, it may then be either voided by the qualifying player, or sent to a referral wallet address whereby the referral will then receive 10% off of their first purchase and will have the same option to void or refer the rebate after redeeming it. The players referring the rebate will then have their name entered into the decentraland data base to participate on the next series of what I am calling the \"Perpetual Gratuity Week\" should their referral redeem their rebate. In this manner, the participating vendors will see a boost in their sales, the players will be given an incentive to purchase new wearables and items, the platform will be lively with activity and buzz, the players will enjoy the appearance of fresh new items to enjoy when engaging on Decentraland, and the word will get out that Decentraland is the place to be for fun events that reward creators and players alike. This can be further illustrated by wrapping up the week with a ceremonial event to reward the vendor that sells the most items with an NFT trophy and to award the player with the most qualified referrals with a free NFT item from one of the participating store's promotional items. This should be a quarterly event so as to keep the platform appealing to players and creators and to allure new players and vendors with opportunity and excitement.\nThe best way to help fund this would be for the Decentraland DAO to use portions of the sales fees collected from participating vendors sales and from the publishing fees of those same vendors that mint their NFT items. Early registration of vendors would be necessary and the allocation of a portion of those fees into the event fund would be necessary to bring this proposal to event-ready status. Advertising the event and the participating vendors and any other sponsors should be done on the many billboards across Decentraland, and the fees for that should be calculated and charged when the participating vendors register for the event. The voucher will be minted in accordance with the exact number of NFT items each participating vendor is registering as available for purchase to the DAO as confirmation of the inventory count for the number of rebates that can be issued. The discord servers and social media should also be used to promote this event. The best way to describe this proposal is that it is incentivization via participation.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is an NFT voucher to purchase NFT's from participating vendors, and to incentivize the purchaser to share the voucher via referring a friend's wallet, who will then have the same opportunity to redeem the voucher and refer a friend as well. I will use the grant to employ a programmer to write the code for this NFT and I will then issue it to the Decentraland DAO for them to mint the necessary amount of vouchers to equal the number of items each participating vendor is selling in this event.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI work with only one designer and coder for these types of projects. We have done collaborations in the past and I am confident we will deliver on this proposal in a timely manner with ease. I am currently working with a freelancer named Anmol M. from freelancer . com. He and I have a great working relationship and he has really came through for me in the past.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI will only need two to three weeks to get this project done. The biggest barrier is that I will require the aid of the DAO in it's full implementation and event planning. If this barrier can be overcame, then I see this getting underway in a very brief time. I tend to drive the bottom line (respectfully) when it comes to deadlines and delivery. I treat those I am involved with in business with respect, appreciation and encouragement.

This will be an NFT rebate and referral voucher meant to incentivize players to purchase wearables from participating vendors as well as to share the rebate via referring a friend's wallet address, whereby the voucher then shows up in there wallet available to use on their first purchase. The voucher will become void if it is not used in a specified time frame. I will describe the model in more detail in the description field.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xeFd13F676744a527B1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8\n\n## Description\n\nThe Circulating Rebate/Referral voucher is an NFT voucher designed to allow the player to receive a 10% discount on their next NFT purchase after making an initial purchase at participating vendor's stores. After the voucher is redeemed for the discount, it may then be either voided by the qualifying player, or sent to a referral wallet address whereby the referral will then receive 10% off of their first purchase and will have the same option to void or refer the rebate after redeeming it. The players referring the rebate will then have their name entered into the decentraland data base to participate on the next series of what I am calling the \"Perpetual Gratuity Week\" should their referral redeem their rebate. In this manner, the participating vendors will see a boost in their sales, the players will be given an incentive to purchase new wearables and items, the platform will be lively with activity and buzz, the players will enjoy the appearance of fresh new items to enjoy when engaging on Decentraland, and the word will get out that Decentraland is the place to be for fun events that reward creators and players alike. This can be further illustrated by wrapping up the week with a ceremonial event to reward the vendor that sells the most items with an NFT trophy and to award the player with the most qualified referrals with a free NFT item from one of the participating store's promotional items. This should be a quarterly event so as to keep the platform appealing to players and creators and to allure new players and vendors with opportunity and excitement.\nThe best way to help fund this would be for the Decentraland DAO to use portions of the sales fees collected from participating vendors sales and from the publishing fees of those same vendors that mint their NFT items. Early registration of vendors would be necessary and the allocation of a portion of those fees into the event fund would be necessary to bring this proposal to event-ready status. Advertising the event and the participating vendors and any other sponsors should be done on the many billboards across Decentraland, and the fees for that should be calculated and charged when the participating vendors register for the event. The voucher will be minted in accordance with the exact number of NFT items each participating vendor is registering as available for purchase to the DAO as confirmation of the inventory count for the number of rebates that can be issued. The discord servers and social media should also be used to promote this event. The best way to describe this proposal is that it is incentivization via participation.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is an NFT voucher to purchase NFT's from participating vendors, and to incentivize the purchaser to share the voucher via referring a friend's wallet, who will then have the same opportunity to redeem the voucher and refer a friend as well. I will use the grant to employ a programmer to write the code for this NFT and I will then issue it to the Decentraland DAO for them to mint the necessary amount of vouchers to equal the number of items each participating vendor is selling in this event.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI work with only one designer and coder for these types of projects. We have done collaborations in the past and I am confident we will deliver on this proposal in a timely manner with ease. I am currently working with a freelancer named Anmol M. from freelancer . com. He and I have a great working relationship and he has really came through for me in the past.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI will only need two to three weeks to get this project done. The biggest barrier is that I will require the aid of the DAO in it's full implementation and event planning. If this barrier can be overcame, then I see this getting underway in a very brief time. I tend to drive the bottom line (respectfully) when it comes to deadlines and delivery. I treat those I am involved with in business with respect, appreciation and encouragement. I recognize that any goals worth achieving require the aid of the talented and the willing, and I invite those types to my circle to strive for achievement and to celebrate any success that follows. I am a bit of a visionary with enthusiasm to create and to build others up while doing so. I also believe in responsible capitalism and investing in others and their aims, should they be worthy of it. This is me, and this is my proposal, and I want to extend a big thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.",

I will use the grant to employ a programmer to write the code for this NFT and I will then issue it to the Decentraland DAO for them to mint the necessary amount of vouchers to equal the number of items each participating vendor is selling in this event.",
             "personnel":"I work with only one designer and coder for these types of projects. We have done collaborations in the past and I am confident we will deliver on this proposal in a timely manner with ease. I am currently working with a freelancer named Anmol M. from freelancer . com. He and I have a great working relationship and he has really came through for me in the past.",
             "roadmap":"I will only need two to three weeks to get this project done. The biggest barrier is that I will require the aid of the DAO in it's full implementation and event planning. If this barrier can be overcame, then I see this getting underway in a very brief time. I tend to drive the bottom line (respectfully) when it comes to deadlines and delivery. I treat those I am involved with in business with respect, appreciation and encouragement. I recognize that any goals worth achieving require the aid of the talented and the willing, and I invite those types to my circle to strive for achievement and to celebrate any success that follows. I am a bit of a visionary with enthusiasm to create and to build others up while doing so. I also believe in responsible capitalism and investing in others and their aims, should they be worthy of it. This is me, and this is my proposal, and I want to extend a big thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.",

I am proffesional 3D models maker, and have thousands of assets for share/sell. If you will add more categories in marketplace it can be much more eazier for players to buy/download(free) assets and dress its LAND. It can be directly accessible from builder.

             "body":"> by 0xe264886feb92e9c6a92fa196dfdc09d330b66c17\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs decentraland grows ever so quickly, a lot of content created is not seen or aware to users. Is it possible to create NFTs like fireworks that could be utilised at their content to attract more users to that spot? For example, new services can have firework animations coming from there.  Or to make it more amazing, real life footage of fireworks created as an NFT. With a new service you would also expect a crowd around the content. Would it be possible to create, for example, NFTs of crowds? So currently we have nightclubs with DJs doing their most to promote their presence and venue. Would it be possible to have different sized NFTs according to crowd size which can be put at the content to create more awareness, like an advertising ploy\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x23Cf8AB359e16929944F1Aa8De0D3c5dCD3A520e\n\n## Description\n\nContent creators require marketing and advertising techniques to allow users an opportunity of letting them know of their presence. Inserting content in Decentraland and establishing their creations is one thing, but driving a market to it and creating sales is something not touched on. Fireworks for new content that shoots high in the air or crowds gathering around new content as you visibly approach it are a couple of ideas that I believe would work well in driving users to the new and exciting content available in Decentraland. What do you think?\n\n\n## Specification\n\nUsing the entertainment industry as an example from real world to Decentraland, Decentraland is missing the crowds at nightclubs in this instance. Videographers with prior crowd footage in the real world could create NFTs and sell this as crowd advertising, potentially being of interest to content creators wanting to get a bit of attention to what they have created. This type of footage is also harder to obtain and create these days due to covid and makes old footage and real footage some what new and valuable again.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI mention this because it is something I have readily available from one of the best DJs in South-East Asia and is something he would like to contribute to the crypto space, including his entrance in. I also have some fireworks lying around which I think could like nice in the virtual world. BAKOOM!!!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMilestones and achievements could be documented as my team and I are already in progress with this concept. Creating different sized crowds or being able to select the size to go accordingly with the size of content created is one of the last issues before it could be rolled out.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=33993260-ec0d-11eb-ba81-318d080cd8d0)**",

Is it possible to create NFTs like fireworks that could be utilised at their content to attract more users to that spot? For example, new services can have firework animations coming from there.  Or to make it more amazing, real life footage of fireworks created as an NFT. With a new service you would also expect a crowd around the content. Would it be possible to create, for example, NFTs of crowds? So currently we have nightclubs with DJs doing their most to promote their presence and venue. Would it be possible to have different sized NFTs according to crowd size which can be put at the content to create more awareness, like an advertising ploy\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x23Cf8AB359e16929944F1Aa8De0D3c5dCD3A520e\n\n## Description\n\nContent creators require marketing and advertising techniques to allow users an opportunity of letting them know of their presence. Inserting content in Decentraland and establishing their creations is one thing, but driving a market to it and creating sales is something not touched on. Fireworks for new content that shoots high in the air or crowds gathering around new content as you visibly approach it are a couple of ideas that I believe would work well in driving users to the new and exciting content available in Decentraland. What do you think?\n\n\n## Specification\n\nUsing the entertainment industry as an example from real world to Decentraland, Decentraland is missing the crowds at nightclubs in this instance. Videographers with prior crowd footage in the real world could create NFTs and sell this as crowd advertising, potentially being of interest to content creators wanting to get a bit of attention to what they have created. This type of footage is also harder to obtain and create these days due to covid and makes old footage and real footage some what new and valuable again.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI mention this because it is something I have readily available from one of the best DJs in South-East Asia and is something he would like to contribute to the crypto space, including his entrance in. I also have some fireworks lying around which I think could like nice in the virtual world. BAKOOM!!!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMilestones and achievements could be documented as my team and I are already in progress with this concept. Creating different sized crowds or being able to select the size to go accordingly with the size of content created is one of the last issues before it could be rolled out.",

Weighted voting would allow the DAO to create ordered lists using MANA (and other voting power) as a weight. Ordered lists can be used in the future for:\n\n*   Creating committees of people from short lists of candidates\n*   Prioritizing initiatives and projects\n*   Maintaining lists of trusted resources\n*   Choosing winners in contests and ranking content\n\nYou can see an example of this feature in Fabien's snapshot here: https://demo.snapshot.org/#/fabien.eth/proposal/QmWpP9PZ2y9Y495q4pf3LXwLBEFNzwqgwQAKyELFG1ZpBk\n\nThere is an example implementation here: https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/blob/develop/src/helpers/voting/weighted.ts\n\nImplementation is non-trivial but not an unreasonable request of the Governance maintainers.\n\n- Yes, I propose to implement weighted voting\n- No, I do not propose to implement weighted voting\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=26afbae0-eb1a-11eb-a8f5-e90274b2ad2c)**",
